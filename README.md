- Hi, Iâ€™m Tony Smoragiewicz
- ðŸ¤– Iâ€™m currently a research assistant in the Complex Dynamic Systems & Control Laboratory at Northeastern University in Boston, USA. I work under Professor Rifat Sipahi where I improve on probablistic models, sensor fusion algorithms, and visual navigation for the [US Army Research Laboratory](https://arl.devcom.army.mil/).
- ðŸŒ¿ Iâ€™m interested in using robotics to promote sustainable agricultural practices or make waste management more economical.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on visual navigation, nonlinear state estimation, and robotic manipulation.
