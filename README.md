- Hi, I’m Tony Smoragiewicz
- 🤖 I’ve recently finished my MSc in Robotics at Northeastern University. Under Professor Rifat Sipahi, I worked on improving probablistic models, sensor fusion algorithms, and visual navigation for the [US Army Research Laboratory](https://arl.devcom.army.mil/).
- 🌿 I’m interested in using robotics to promote sustainable agricultural practices or make waste management more economical.
- 👀 I’m looking to collaborate on visual navigation, nonlinear state estimation, and robotic manipulation.
- 📫 You can reach me at: smoragiewicz.t@northeastern.edu
